## Setting up your development environment

The recommended way to setup your development environment for this repo is to open it in a
[GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

Some of the benefits of using Codespaces for the IDE include:

- ensures that everyone contributing to the code has exactly the same local development configured
- ensures that the local development environment is documented via configuration as code
- allows anyone contributing to the code for the first time to get up and running quickly and easily

### Codespace requirements

Literally all you need is either:
- a web browser, or
- VS Code (recommended)

[Web browser Codespaces documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/developing-in-a-codespace?tool=webui#working-in-a-codespace-in-the-browser)

[VS Code Codespaces documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/developing-in-a-codespace?tool=vscode#working-in-a-codespace-in-vs-code)

All you need to do is click on the green `<> Code` dropdown button on the 
[GitHub repo page](https://github.com/tobyurff/coliving-semkovo),
and then choose: `Create codespace on main`.
